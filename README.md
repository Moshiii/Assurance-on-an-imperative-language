## Synopsis

This project built a small symbolic execution engine to transfer concrete language and built a small verification engine based on the former engine. Both of them based on an imperative language (WHILE). A skeleton for a symbolic interpreter is given by our professor Arie Gurfinkel.


## Motivation

This project is used to improve my skill in the Software Testing, Quality, Assurance, Maintenance.

## Installation

1.Install Python 2.7<br>
2.Open the interpreter using the following command:$ python -m wlang.int wlang/test1.prg<br>
3.Execute the sample program using the following command: python -m wlang.sym wlang/test1.prg<br>
